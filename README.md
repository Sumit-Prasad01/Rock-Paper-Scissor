# Rock Paper Scissors Game with PyQt5
# Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic "Rock Paper Scissors" game using the PyQt5 library in Python. It allows the user to play against the computer, where the computer's choice is randomly generated. The game features a user interface with buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors choices, as well as a "Reset" button to restart the game.

# Features
Interactive UI: Buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors, with visual updates for both the user and the computer.
Game Logic: The computer's choice is randomly generated, and the winner is determined based on the classic rules of the game.
Timer: A countdown timer is used to delay the computer's choice, making the game more dynamic.
Result Display: After each round, the winner is displayed (User, Computer, or Draw).
Reset Functionality: Users can reset the game to start a new round.
